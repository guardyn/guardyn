# Commit Message Guidelines

## Structure

- **Type**: Begin with a type prefix that indicates the nature of the change
  - `feat`: New feature
  - `fix`: Bug fix
  - `docs`: Documentation changes
  - `style`: Code style changes (formatting, semicolons)
  - `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
  - `perf`: Performance improvements
  - `test`: Adding or correcting tests
  - `build`: Changes to build system or dependencies
  - `ci`: Changes to CI configuration
  - `chore`: Regular maintenance tasks

## Format

- Begin with type in lowercase: `feat:`, `fix:`, etc.
- Use imperative mood (e.g., "add" not "added" or "adds")
- First line should be 50 characters or less
- Include a blank line between summary and description
- Wrap description text at 72 characters 

## Best Practices

- Be specific about what changes were made
- Explain "why" not just "what" in the description
- Reference issue numbers when applicable: `#123`
- Separate commits for separate concerns
- Avoid vague messages like "fixes", "updates", etc.

## Examples

### Good

```text
feat: add user authentication functionality

Implement JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens.
Includes login, logout, and token refresh endpoints.

Resolves #45
```

### Bad

```text
# Non-English commit message
исправил ошибку в модуле входа
```

```text
fixed stuff
```

## Language Requirements

- **English Only**: All commit messages MUST be written in English
- This applies to both the summary line and detailed description
- Non-English commit messages will be rejected in code reviews
- Using translation tools is acceptable for non-native English speakers

## Project-Specific Guidelines

- Always write commit messages in English
- Include relevant module/service name when appropriate
- For multi-tenant related changes, prefix with `[tenant]`
- For security-related commits, prefix with `[security]`
